# personal-health-insurance-cost-prediction
The Personal Health Insurance Cost Prediction project estimates insurance premiums using factors like age, BMI, smoking status, and region. It applies ML models (Linear Regression, Random Forest,...) for accurate cost predictions. The project includes data preprocessing, model evaluation, and future deployment as an API for real-world applications.
